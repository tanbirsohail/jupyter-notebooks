# jupyter-notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tanbirsohail/jupyter-notebooks/master)

A repository of all my jupyter notebooks to use at mybinder.org. I have added notes on all basic python frameworks, which are based on practice notes from various moocs and tutorials. I have also included a requirements file and a binder launcher link so that a standalone jupyter notebook environment can be loaded in mybinder.org.

I have included a few basic libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and Folium.
